# Voxkryptia

**Voxkryptia** is a conceptual framework and modular security architecture for modern database systems. It introduces a new layer of intelligent protection by integrating AI-powered access monitoring, zero-knowledge role verification, and advanced access transparency features.

## Overview

Voxkryptia addresses the growing need for proactive, adaptive, and privacy-focused security in database environments. Traditional models like RBAC and static firewalls are insufficient for the dynamic, distributed, and AI-integrated workloads of today.

Voxkryptia is not a single tool, but a modular concept that can be built using modern AI, cryptography, and cloud-native design.

## Core Modules

### 1. AI-Powered Access Pattern Anomaly Detection

**Goal:** Detect and prevent unusual or risky access behavior.

**Features:**

- Learns query behavior per user or role
- Flags anomalies such as:
  - Unusual read/write frequency
  - Off-hours access patterns
  - Suspicious table scans or mass deletions

**Tech Stack Suggestion:** Python, PostgreSQL logs, scikit-learn or PyOD, optional visual dashboard

---

### 2. Context-Aware Query Validator

**Goal:** Evaluate the intention behind each SQL query using semantic and behavioral analysis.

**Features:**

- Uses LLMs to analyze query meaning
- Alerts or blocks:
  - Dangerous operations (e.g., DROP, mass DELETE)
  - High-impact queries without justification
- Optional approval workflows for risky actions

---

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Role Assignment (ZKRA)

**Goal:** Allow users to prove authorization without revealing their identity to the database.

**Features:**

- Uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) or blind signature schemes
- Assigns access rights securely and privately
- Ideal for environments where privacy is essential (e.g., healthcare, journalism)

**Suggested Libraries:** Semaphore, Zokrates, SnarkJS

---

### 4. User-Centric Data Visibility Matrix

**Goal:** Provide real-time transparency into who can access what data and at what level.

**Features:**

- Visual permission matrix across roles, tables, and fields
- Read, write, masked, or blocked status indicators
- Developer and compliance-friendly audit view

**Implementation Ideas:** React/Vue frontend, Flask/Django backend, live RBAC parser

---

### 5. Geo-Fencing Based Access Control (Optional)

**Goal:** Restrict or manage access based on geographic location.

**Use Cases:**

- Region-locked data access
- Detection of VPN or proxy usage
- Enforcing country-specific compliance

**Tools:** MaxMind GeoIP, IP location APIs, GPS (for mobile access)
